This is a simple app that was created for the purpose of getting a little more experience creating a full CRUD app. The user is able to add a shower thought to a list, delete a thought, or edit an existing thought. A few examples are hard-coded, but if this were to be put into production, it is likely that a login feature would be added so each user has a unique list.

Main Technologies:
React, Redux, Material UI
